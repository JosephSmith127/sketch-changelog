> A <a href="sketchapp.com">Sketch</a> plugin to find documentation for components from Sketch

We use Sketch as our primary design tool at SeatGeek, it allows the use of plugins for various workflows which we can take advantage of. 

To save time and improve the usefulness of the upcoming SeatGeek Design Documention I've created a plugin that will allow you to hit `CMD + Shift + P` to open the documention for the selected component.

Sketch Bridge can help you:

- Find documention for components directly from Sketch
- Get code samples for selected components
- View best practices for components while designing

## Download & Install

I'll update this section when the SeatGeek Design Documention is in a better state

## Questions?
